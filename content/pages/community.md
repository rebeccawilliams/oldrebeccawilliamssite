      - title: Civic Tech Book Club
        content: >
          [Civic Tech Book Club](https://civictechbook.club/) is a virtual book
          club that meets sporadically to discuss [readings related to civics
          and
          technology](https://bookshop.org/lists/civic-tech-book-club-reading-list).
          The group was created in 2015 by [Forest
          Gregg](https://github.com/fgregg), [Rebecca
          Ackerman](https://github.com/rcackerman), and [Rebecca
          Williams](https://github.com/rebeccawilliams) who lived far apart from
          each other and wanted a space to discuss readings related to civic
          technology studies. Since the pandemic, the virtual group has taken on
          a new life and meets more frequently and often has authors join for
          discussions.
