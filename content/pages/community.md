        content: "A virtual book club with a critical lens on civics ∩\_ technology.\n\nCivic Tech Book Club was created in 2015 by Forest Gregg, Rebecca Ackerman, and Rebecca Williams (members of the “civic tech” community) who lived far apart from each other and wanted a space to discuss readings. Since the pandemic, the virtual group has taken on a new life and meets more frequently.\n"

      - title: DC Legal Hackers
        content: >
          DC Legal Hackers is meetup group of 1700+ technologists, lawyers, and
          policymakers that meet to discuss and hack everything betwixt law and
          technology. I helped found the group and host 70+ panels, trainings,
          and hackathons over 7 years. It was the second chapter in a network
          the Legal Hacker Community which now boasts 130+ chapters across 6
          contitents. While co-organizing DGLH I also served on the Legal
          Hackers board.


          If you are interested in taking over leadership of DC Legal Hackers
          please get in touch.
