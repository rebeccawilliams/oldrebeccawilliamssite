        subtitle: Civic Technology and Information Policy Analyst
        content: >
          **Rebecca Williams** is an expert in government data and technology
          policy. She has worked at all jurisdiction levels, inside and outside
          of government, as a civil servant, consultant, and advocate at
          Harvard, the White House (twice), the Sunlight Foundation, and more.
          Committed to her continued learning and everyone's, she has hosted
          online and offline groups to discuss issues betwixt civics and
          technology with Civic Tech Book Club and DC Legal Hackers. She holds a
          B.A. in Communication from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and
          a J.D. from Western New England University School of Law. She has won
          numerous legal tech awards, including American Bar Association's first
          10 Women to Watch in Legal Tech.


          She would like to see modern tools–with all their capabilities–used in
          the service of justice and democracy and speaks about how that is too
          often not the case in niche and broad ways on Twitter and elsewhere.
          She is the daughter of a psychologist and tax attorney from a
          struggling *Most Dangerous* city who gets the bottom line. According
          to her father she is a true millennial, and she can definitely attest
          to what she sees as fundamental generational pressures and trends. She
          sees the world in power struggles, trajectories, and people talking
          past each other. She believes in art, balance, cutting out what
          doesn't work, density, diversity, and humor. She wants to ask you
          about the latest thing you enjoyed and why over a coffee, tea, or a
          drink to better understand herself and everything.
