          She would like to see modern tools–with all their capabilities–used in
          the service of justice and democracy and speaks about how that is too
          often not the case in niche and broad ways on Twitter and elsewhere.
          She is the daughter of a psychologist and tax attorney from a
          struggling "most dangerous city" who understands all the bottom lines.


          According to her father, she is a true millennial. Whether she is or
          not, she can faithfully attest to what she sees as fundamental
          generational pressures and trends. She sees the world in power
          struggles, trajectories, and people talking past each other. She
          believes in art, balance, cutting out what doesn't work, density,
          diversity, and humor. She wants to ask you about the latest thing you
          enjoyed and why over a coffee, tea, or a drink to better understand
          you, herself, and the world.
