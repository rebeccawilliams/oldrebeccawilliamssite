          Rebecca was raised by a psychologist and tax attorney in Springfield,
          MA where she learned from an early age to study critically all of the
          ways the world is not fair. Rebecca sees the world in power struggles,
          trajectories, and people talking past each other.  She believes in
          art, balance, diversity, and humor. She wants to ask you about the
          latest thing you enjoyed to better understand you, the world, and
          herself.
