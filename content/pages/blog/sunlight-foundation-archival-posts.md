I certainly "cut my teeth" at the Sunlight Foundation (RIP) and have often been associated with org even though I was only there a short time. While there from 2013-2014, I worked on the [Open Data Policy Guidelines (2.0)](https://opendatapolicyhub.sunlightfoundation.com/guidelines/), [tracking open data policies](https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/opendatamap/), the [U.S. City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/), and [wrote on various gaps related to open data](https://sunlightfoundation.com/author/rwilliams/).
