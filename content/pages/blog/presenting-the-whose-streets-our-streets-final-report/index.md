For Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs’ Technology and Public Purpose (TAPP) Project, I
researched harms to civil liberties posed by “smart city” technology. This research was [originally inspired](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/introducing-whose-streets-our-streets-developing-interventions-protect-civil-liberties) by protests to high-profile “smart city” projects like Sidewalk Toronto and a nascent regulatory landscape for surveillance technologies. After many interviews, [public records requests](https://www.muckrock.com/project/whose-streets-our-streets-tech-edition-863/), and the methodical tracking of related news during the fellowship via the [*Whose Streets? Our Streets! Newsletter*](https://whosestreets.substack.com/), this report culminates my research and serves as a 2020-21 time capsule of “smart city” cautionary trends and 10 calls to action to blunt these trends.

##### *The* Whose Streets? Our Streets! (Tech Edition) *final report* includes:

*   A look at how technology is affecting society through the lens of *our streets*, which have historically been crucial commons for convening democratic protests. 

<!---->

*   An outline of how “smart city” cameras, location trackers, and sensors collect data that can identify, and target, individuals. 

<!---->

*   A framework of cautionary trends (*Totalitarianism, Panopticonism, Discrimination, Privatization, and Solutionism*) with 50+ real-world examples from 2020-21. 

<!---->

*   10 calls to action that summarize related 2020-21 regulatory approaches to build on and communities to get involved with. These calls to action ask that we *Stop Harmful “Smart City” Technology, Data, and Uses; Build Our Collective Capacity to Evaluate How Technology Impacts Democracy*; and *Fortify Old and Build New Democratic Spaces*.
