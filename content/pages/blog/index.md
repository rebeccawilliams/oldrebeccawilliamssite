          # Presenting the Whose Streets? Our Streets! (Tech Edition) Final
          Report


          The culmination of 2020-21 research on harms to civil liberties posed
          by "smart city" technology.


          For Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and
          International Affairs’ Technology and Public Purpose (TAPP) Project, I
          researched harms to civil liberties posed by “smart city” technology.
          This research was [originally
          inspired](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/introducing-whose-streets-our-streets-developing-interventions-protect-civil-liberties)
          by protests to high-profile “smart city” projects like Sidewalk
          Toronto and a nascent regulatory landscape for surveillance
          technologies. After many interviews, [public records
          requests](https://www.muckrock.com/project/whose-streets-our-streets-tech-edition-863/),
          and the methodical tracking of related news during the fellowship via
          the [*Whose Streets? Our Streets!
          Newsletter*](https://whosestreets.substack.com/), this report
          culminates my research and serves as a 2020-21 time capsule  of “smart
          city” cautionary trends and 10 calls to action to blunt these trends.


          #### The *Whose Streets? Our Streets! (Tech Edition)* final report
          includes:


          *   A look at how technology is affecting society through the lens of
          *our streets*, which have historically been crucial commons for
          convening democratic protests.


          *   An outline of how “smart city” cameras, location trackers, and
          sensors collect data that can identify, and target, individuals.


          *   A framework of cautionary trends (*Totalitarianism, Panopticonism,
          Discrimination, Privatization, and Solutionism*) with 50+ real-world
          examples from 2020-21.


          *   10 calls to action that summarize related 2020-21 regulatory
          approaches to build on and communities to get involved with. These
          calls to action ask that we *Stop Harmful “Smart City” Technology,
          Data, and Uses; Build Our Collective Capacity to Evaluate How
          Technology Impacts Democracy*; and *Fortify Old and Build New
          Democratic Spaces*.
