          This project came out of the beautiful frustration of trying to train
          folks on implementing some poorly defined data policy laws that will
          not be mentioned, but might show up if you refresh the page enough.

          Years later this title seems less satisfying, but at the time I was
          imagining a Google for government activity. New Google searches across
          government databases, a rogue Data.gov if you will. I made this from
          open source code that was already out there before working at the real
          Data.gov and before Google launched their Google Dataset Search.
