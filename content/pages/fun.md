          Years later this title seems less satisfying, but imagine a Google for
          government activity was the thinking. New Google searches across
          government databases, a rouge Data.gov if you will. I made this on top
          of open source code that was already out there before working at the
          real Data.gov and before Google launched their Google Dataset Search.
