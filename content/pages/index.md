      - title: Technology and Public Purpose Project Resesearch
        subtitle: >-
          I am spending the 2020-21 academic year researching harms related to
          “smart city” technologies.
        content: >
          My goals of this research are to support people already doing related
          research and advocacy and to produce a risk framework, assessment of
          current policies and practices, and set of recommendations to prevent
          these harms.

        content: >
          CTBC was created in 2015 by Forest Gregg, Rebecca Ackerman, and
          Rebecca Williams (members of the “civic tech” community) who lived far
          apart from each other and wanted a space to discuss readings. Since
          the pandemic, the virtual group has taken on a new life and meets more
          frequently.
