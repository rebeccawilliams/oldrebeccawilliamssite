          CTBC was created in 2015 by Forest Gregg, Rebecca Ackerman, and
          Rebecca Williams (members of the “civic tech” community) who lived far
          apart from each other and wanted a space to discuss readings. Since
          the pandemic, the virtual group has taken on a new life and meets more
          frequently.
