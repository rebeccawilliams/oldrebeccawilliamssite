    title: Rebecca Williams
    content: >
      Rebecca Williams has been studying various government information access
      policies for the last eight years and she's been on the internet for much
      longer. She is deeply curious about how new data/tech schemes double down
      on our worst injustices and upend how we think about things and she is
      also interested in oil painting, poetry, and being ridiculous. She has
      lived along the Northeast Regional Amtrak line her whole life and
      currently lives in Brooklyn with her dog, Hannah Arendt.

        content: >
          CTBC was created in 2015 by Forest Gregg, Rebecca Ackerman, and
          Rebecca Williams (members of the “civic tech” community) who lived far
          apart from each other and wanted a space to discuss readings. Since
          the pandemic, the virtual group has taken on a new life and meets more
          frequently.
