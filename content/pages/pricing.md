        content: >
          Civic Tech Book Club was created in 2015 by Forest Gregg, Rebecca
          Ackerman, and Rebecca Williams (members of the “civic tech” community)
          who lived far apart from each other and wanted a space to discuss
          readings. Since the pandemic, the virtual group has taken on a new
          life and meets more frequently.
